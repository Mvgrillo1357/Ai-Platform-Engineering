For my personal individual project I would like to use machine learning in order to find trends over an extensive dataset which documents all traffic violations in 49 states of the United States collected from February 2016 to December 2019. The data set used was gathered from https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents. By deploying a machine learning model that can predict trends and categorize variables I will be able be able to make predictive geographic clustering.

https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents this link defines the various variables of the dataset. This dataset is a live document but I used the data that lasted from February 2016 to December 2019.
